### To reproduce Figures 7, 8, and 9 in the above paper:
* Download the repo.
* Open MATLAB and add to path this repo and all its subfolders.
* Run **lggp_compare.m** in MATLAB.
* A new file **lggp_exp_data.mat** should appear in the folder when the script finishes.
* Run **lggp_compare_plot.m** in MATLAB.
* Three pdfs corresponding to the three figures should appear in the folder.
